A tool for testing a corpus of meson builds

./run.py runs the test in local docker containers
./update.py updates the meson-corpus-test repository

If project PROJ fails in the CI made by update.py, you can try `./run.py PROJECT
--interactive` to investigate locally.

TODO:
- I've got away without any projects using a non-default meson configuration, but probably needed eventually
- Invoke ninja to build/test/install to verify we've generated correctly ?
- Since we're always providing all builddeps, we're not exercising fallbacks
- Pin to a specific git commit (not bleeding edge so artful can satisify builddeps & to avoid false reports due to upstream breakage)
