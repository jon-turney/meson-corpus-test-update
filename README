A tool for updating the meson-corpus-test repository

TODO:
- I've got away without any projects using a non-default meson configuration, but probably needed eventually
- Default env vars in script, rather than in python
- Invoke ninja to build/test/install to verify we've generated correctly ?
- Since we're always providing all builddeps, we're not exercising fallbacks
