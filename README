A tool for updating the meson-corpus-test repository

TODO:
- build a docker container, based on a later Ubuntu, and pre-populated with build-deps
- use that container in build script
- I've got away without any projects using a non-default meson configuration, but probably needed eventually
- Default env vars in script, rather than in python
- Invoke ninja to build/test/install to verify we've generated correctly ?
