A tool for updating the meson-corpus-test repository

TODO:
- I've got away without any projects using a non-default meson configuration, but probably needed eventually
- Invoke ninja to build/test/install to verify we've generated correctly ?
- Since we're always providing all builddeps, we're not exercising fallbacks
- Pin to a specific git commit (not bleeding edge so artful can satisify builddeps & to avoid false reports due to upstream breakage)
